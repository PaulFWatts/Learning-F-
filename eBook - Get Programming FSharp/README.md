# Get Programming with F#

This repository contains all F# code listings as required for all exercises and samples within the 'Get Programming with F#' book, available [here]( https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp).

To install all dependencies as needed for the exercises, simply run the build.cmd file, which uses Paket to download all NuGet dependencies.

## Using VS Code / VS2017 / VS2019 and .NET Core?
Switch to the `netcore` branch of this repository. Many of the lessons and modules have been upgraded to the "new" project structure and should "just work"!
